# EsoHype
An esoteric programming language written in Lua where you have to be nice.

## Variables
To define variables, you need to ask the interpreter to define it, for example:
```py
can x be 5 pls
```
where `x` is the variable name and `5` is the value you want to set it to, for example, a number.

Variables can be used almost anywhere, for example, in `display` statements:
```py
can y be 27 pls
display y # Outputs 27
```

They can also contain strings:
```py
can y be "this works!" pls
display y
```
as well as basic arithmetic:
```py
can z be 5 * (2 + 5) pls
display z
```
and they also can be reassigned.
```py
can x be 27 / 2 pls
display x
can x be 5 * 5 pls
display x
```
