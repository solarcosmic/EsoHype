## How to Run
EsoHype requires Lua - as EsoHype is written in Lua.

## Executable
EsoHype can come packaged as a Windows executable. If you're on Windows and don't want to install Lua, you can experiment with the compiled executable by downloading it here. It should then ask you to provide a script, and then you're set!

However, if you want to get the most pure version of EsoHype, you may want to use Lua binaries.
